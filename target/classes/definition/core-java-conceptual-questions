Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. It is a set of rules to instruct computers or other devices to perform specific tasks.




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.JDK is the Java Development Kit and it is a software development environment with tools that are needed to develop
 Java applications.
 It includes the  JRE which is the Java Runtime Environment and it enables java programs to be able to run on any computer.
  The last component of the JDK is the JVM which is the Java Virtual Machine and this is responsible for compiling and
  executing java programs.  There is a JIT in the JVM and it sands for just-in-time compiler which speeds up the execution.





What is IDE?
A.IDE is an integrated development environment. They are java development tools that are used to develop Java programs quickly.
They have editing, compiling, building, debugging, etc in one user interface.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A.NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ.


Explain the entire java life cycle.
The three main stages are first to edit the program and create it, compile the source code, and then execute the
byte cote. First we start with building the program on a text editor, then we compile the program using javac, and then
the last step is execution.

what is class?
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.

What is object?
An object is an instance of a class. The objects are any entities that have states and behaviors.

What is the entry point of an application?
The main method.

Why main is static?
This is so that the method can be called without creating an object or an object of the class.
This is so the JVM can load the class into memory and then call the main method.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Path is an environmental variable, and it is used by the Operating system to locate exe files or java binaries.
Classpath is used by an Application ClassLoader to find and load.class files.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Interface only has static and final variables.
Abstract classes can inherit another class using keyword and create a new interface.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No neither class can make an object. An interface is an abstract class. Interface cannot contain a constructor.
Interfaces are used to achieve security and hide important details.

what is Access Specifier?
The access specifier specifies how accessible a field, method, constructor or class is.
The access level can be changed using this specifier.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object oriented programming.
Encapsulation is putting together variables into a single Class.
It also provides security by keeping data and methods safe.
Inheritance is the ability to create classes that share attributes of existing classes, but with more detail and features.
Polymorphism means that the same word or symbol can be interpreted correctly based on the context.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Package is the mechanism to organize java classes. Java.lang is imported in a java program by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API is an application programming interface, and it enables companies to open up their data to other parties.
 It is a set of defined rules that computers or applications use to communicate.
 Social media used API for logins,paypal is another one, and any online shopping.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java does not support multiple inheritance because there is too much confusion and ambiguity.
The compiler will not know which class method to call.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
This is when methods have the same name but different parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception is an event that disrupts the program and how it was supposed to flow. It is an unwanted or unexpected.
It can be caught and handled by the program itself. Java try and catch is the best way to handle it.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
his keyword static means that the same variable or method is shared in a class.
Static methods can be accessed without creating an object of a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
This is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes, and methods which make them unchangeable.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is the non-access modifier that makes classes, methods, attributes unchangeable.
Finally, is used with exceptions, it is executed whether there is an exception or not.
Finalize is called by the garbage collector and it performs clean up activity.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
It is called when an object of a class is created. The constructor’s name must match the class name.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Yes, but not two constructors with the same parameters.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
There is then a default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
It refers to the current object in the method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
This refers to the superclass (parent) objects.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
No JVM is platform dependent.

What version of java are you using?
Version 8

What is JAR stand for ?
This stands for Java Archive. It is used as a general archiving tool.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is the software development kit and JVM is the environment for executing bytecode.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
JVM is the environment for executing bytecode and
JRE is the Java Runtime Environment which is a package including necessary parts to run a Java program including the JVM.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is when the code gets translated to a byte code to create a runnable code.
Run time is the execution of the program.

What is heap?
Heap space is where objects are created. Heap memory is created when JVM starts.

How java manage it's memory?
Java has an automatic garbage collector to manage memory.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Strings are immutable, while StringBugger and StringBuilder are mutable. String stores in the string pool, while buffer and builder
are in heap. Strings are not used in a threaded environment, but the buffer and builder are.StringBuilder is the fastest processer
of the three.

What is Singleton class?
This class is used to limit objects to only one. Any instances of singleton class will only occur once.
 It also provides global access to other classes through the single object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
This is to mark this variable to not be serialized. They can’t be used with the static keyword.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
The while loop executes one or multiple statements after testing the loop at the start of the iteration.
The do while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly.

What is Enum?
This is a unique data type that allows variables to be a set of predefined constants.
This class represents a group of constants, and these variables are unchangeable.

What is Iterator?
This is an object that can be used to loop through collections. It is used to traverse each element in the collection.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Integer will take more memory.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
They are cached in the String pool, and they are immutable because of the security and class loading.
String is unchangeable or unmodifiable.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
This is when there is a sequence of constructors, and it is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Serial garbage collector uses one thread for the garbage collection process, while the parallel garbage collector uses many threads.

What is JIT stands for?
Just in time compiler. It improves the performance of Java.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
The java objects live in an area call the heap and the heap is created when JVM starts to run.
If the heap space is full, then the garbage collection process begins and garbage is collected.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No, there is no guarantee.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
ack is used for methods that are running, and the heap space contains all objects are created.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
It allows the program to examine itself and give information about the class.
It is useful and can be used to find additional information such as classes and methods.
Most programming languages do not have this feature.

what is multithreading in java?
This refers to the executing two or more threads at the same time. Threads are usually a light weight process.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
This is to ensure reliable communication and access of multiple  threads. It prevents thread interference as well.

What is Framework?
The framework consists of the codes already written to make up the body of the program.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
Selenium, jUniy, testNG, serenity.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
Junit Is an open sourced framework while testNG is a java based framework.
TesnNG can support parallel tests, but junit cannot and cannot group test while testNG can.

What are the dependencies for this project?
Junit, MongoDM Java Driver, MySQL Connector

what is dependency injection in java?
This is when you transfer over the class into an object and then inject them into any other managed object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding is when the compiler maps the method at compile time, and in dynamic binding, the method is resolved at runtime.
